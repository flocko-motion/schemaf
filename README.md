schemaf is an opinionated framework that eliminates infrastructure churn by making all the boring decisions for you. Build production-ready applications with Go backend, Postgres, and static frontend immediately - no setup, no bikeshedding.

The name "Schema F" comes from the German expression meaning "the standard operating procedure" or "the tried-and-true method" - which is exactly what this framework provides: a reliable, proven approach to project infrastructure.

## Golden Rule

**If it can be generalized, put it in schemaf. If arbitrary decisions need to be made: decide them normatively in the framework. Leave only creative decisions to the application layer.**

schemaf deliberately reduces degrees of freedom. We cement:
- Run scripts and CLI tooling
- Code generation workflows (one command → everything)
- Docker compose layout and dependency resolution
- Port assignments
- Database choice and migration patterns
- Server architecture (the Go server is the gateway)
- Glue code generation (migrations provider, endpoint provider, etc.)

You focus on:
- Your database schema
- Your API endpoints
- Your frontend UI

This repository is the framework itself. The example project lives in `example/` and demonstrates how a project consumes the framework.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js (for TypeScript codegen and frontend)
- `gotestsum` for pretty test output (recommended):
  ```bash
  go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest
  ```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create your project structure (normative paths)
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
mkdir -p go/db/migrations go/db/queries go/api go/db frontend

# 2. Create minimal main.go
cat > go/main.go <<EOF
package main
import (
    "context"
    "github.com/yourorg/schemaf"
    "myapp/go/api"
    "myapp/go/db"
)
func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    app := schemaf.New(ctx)
    app.AddDb(db.Provider)
    app.AddApi(api.Provider)
    app.Run()
}
EOF

# 3. Write a migration
cat > go/db/migrations/001_users.sql <<EOF
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
EOF

# 4. Write a query
cat > go/db/queries/users.sql <<EOF
-- name: GetUser :one
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;
EOF

# 5. Write a handler
cat > go/api/users.go <<EOF
package api
func GetUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // Your handler logic
}
EOF

# 6. Generate
./schemaf.sh codegen

# 7. Run
./schemaf.sh dev
```

**That's it.** The framework:
- Generates `go/db/queries.gen.go` → type-safe query functions (sqlc)
- Generates `go/db/migrations.gen.go` → `db.Provider` with embedded SQL
- Generates `go/api/endpoints.gen.go` → `api.Provider` with handler registration
- Generates `frontend/api/openapi.gen.ts` → TypeScript client
- Wires everything via provider pattern in main.go
- Provides `/health`, `/status`, auth layer
- Serves your frontend (if present)
- All on port 7000

You write SQL, handlers, and frontend. The framework generates all glue code.

## Project Structure (Normative)

schemaf expects a specific directory layout. No configuration, no flexibility - this is the structure:

```
myapp/
├── schemaf.toml                    # Minimal config (title, name)
├── schemaf.sh                      # Copy from schemaf repo — project entrypoint
├── gen/                            # All generated files (gitignored)
│   ├── compose.gen.yml             # Generated: merged compose definition
│   └── openapi.json                # Generated: OpenAPI spec
├── go/                            # All Go code (CLI + server unified)
│   ├── main.go                    # Wire up providers, start app
│   ├── db/                        # All database concerns
│   │   ├── migrations/            # Your SQL migrations
│   │   │   ├── 001_users.sql
│   │   │   └── 002_posts.sql
│   │   ├── queries/               # Your SQL queries (sqlc input)
│   │   │   └── users.sql
│   │   ├── queries.gen.go         # Generated: sqlc query functions
│   │   └── migrations.gen.go      # Generated: db.Provider
│   └── api/                       # Your API handlers (normative!)
│       ├── users.go              # Your handler implementations
│       └── endpoints.gen.go      # Generated: api.Provider
├── frontend/                      # Your static site (any language/framework)
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── openapi.gen.ts        # Generated: TypeScript client
│   ├── src/
│   └── package.json
└── compose/                       # Optional: docker-compose overrides
```

**Why normative paths?**
- Zero decisions about "where do I put this?"
- Codegen knows exactly where to write generated providers
- No configuration needed
- Clone any schemaf project and the structure is identical

**Path rules:**
- `go/db/migrations/*.sql` → migrations (input)
- `go/db/queries/*.sql` → sqlc input
- `go/db/migrations.gen.go` → generated `db.Provider`
- `go/db/queries.gen.go` → generated query functions
- `go/api/*.go` → your API handlers (normative!)
- `go/api/endpoints.gen.go` → generated `api.Provider`
- `frontend/api/openapi.gen.ts` → generated TypeScript client

**Generated file naming:**
All generated files use `.gen.` infix (e.g., `*.gen.go`, `*.gen.ts`) making them instantly recognizable and easy to `.gitignore`.

**Recommended .gitignore:**
```gitignore
gen/
```

The entire `gen/` directory is gitignored — run `./schemaf.sh codegen` after checkout to regenerate everything.

## What schemaf Provides

schemaf is **batteries-included**. These are built-in, not optional:

- **Server with default endpoints**: `/health`, `/status`, auth layer
  - Go server is the gateway
  - Binds `/api/*` for your handlers + framework endpoints
  - Binds `/` for frontend (proxy in dev, embed in production)
  - Single exposed port (7000)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth, fully managed by the framework
  - Bearer token in `Authorization` header
  - Signing key is auto-generated on first boot and stored in Postgres (`_schemaf_config` table)
  - No configuration, no secrets to manage — the framework owns the key entirely
  - Auth is declared per-endpoint (see Endpoint Interface below) — `/health` and `/status` are always open
- **Database**: Postgres is the built-in, always-present SQL database
  - schemaf provisions and manages Postgres — no setup, no configuration
  - It is the one and only SQL database in a schemaf project
  - You add tables, migrations, and queries; the infrastructure is handled for you
  - Write SQL in `go/db/migrations/` and `go/db/queries/`
  - Run `./myapp codegen .` - generates providers
  - Wire up: `app.AddDb(db.Provider)` in main.go
  - Generated: `go/db/queries.gen.go`, `go/db/migrations.gen.go`
  - Need a graph DB, NoSQL store, or other data layer? Add it as a Docker container in your project's `compose/` — it becomes part of the app
- **API endpoints**: Structs implementing a typed interface — not plain functions
  - Request and response types are Go generics on the struct — the framework handles JSON decode, validate, encode
  - No boilerplate: your `Handle` method receives a typed request and returns a typed response
  - Auth, method, and path are declared as interface methods on the struct
  - Codegen scans endpoint structs → generates `api.Provider` + full OpenAPI spec → generates TypeScript client
  - Type-safe end to end, no running server needed for codegen
  - Wire up: `app.AddApi(api.Provider)` in main.go
- **Docker compose**: Built-in compose for backend and Postgres — merged with `compose/` in your project, generated to `gen/compose.gen.yml`
- **Ports**: Fixed allocation (see below)
- **Project entrypoint**: `schemaf.sh codegen`, `schemaf.sh test`, `schemaf.sh run`, `schemaf.sh dev`

## What You Add

Projects built with schemaf **add only creative logic**:

- **Database schema**: Write SQL migrations in `go/db/migrations/`
- **Database queries**: Write SQL queries in `go/db/queries/`
- **API handlers**: Write Go handlers in `go/api/` (normative!)
- **Frontend**: Any static site framework in `frontend/` (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Optional services**: Additional Docker containers if needed (Redis, workers, etc.)
- **Optional CLI commands**: Add custom commands to `main.go` if needed (rarely necessary)
- **Tests**: Write test suites, hook them in via `testing.Provider` — same pattern as everything else

**That's it.** No configuration files (except minimal `schemaf.toml`). No binding framework commands. No decisions about project structure - it's normative.

## Server Architecture

The Go server built from schemaf **is the gateway**.

```
Your Application (port 7000)
├── /api/*        → Go handlers (your business logic)
└── /*            → Frontend
    ├── Dev:      Proxy to frontend dev server (port 7002)
    └── Prod:     Serve embedded static files
```

In production, frontend assets are embedded at build time via `//go:embed` and served directly by the Go server. In dev mode, the Go server proxies frontend requests to the dev server on port 7002.

**Default endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check (built-in)
- `/status` - Service status (built-in)
- `/api/*` - Your handlers + auth layer (framework provides auth, you add business logic)

## schemaf.sh

`schemaf.sh` is your project entrypoint — copy it from the schemaf repo next to `schemaf.toml`:

```bash
./schemaf.sh codegen         # Generate all code (SQL, endpoints, TypeScript client)
./schemaf.sh test            # Regenerate, then run all tests
./schemaf.sh test --verbose  # Verbose test output
./schemaf.sh test --no-cache # Bypass test cache
./schemaf.sh run             # Start production compose stack
./schemaf.sh dev             # Start dev compose stack (exposes service ports)
./schemaf.sh dev postgres    # Start only specific services
```

`run` and `dev` exec into `docker compose` and exit — the actual server runs inside the container.

## Your Application CLI

Your built binary has additional built-in commands and can be extended with your own:

```bash
./myapp server               # Run the HTTP server (used inside the Docker container)
./myapp import               # Example custom subcommand — does whatever you implement
```

Custom subcommands added via `app.AddSubcommand()` run directly — no server, no compose, just your code. Use them for data imports, admin tasks, one-off scripts, anything that benefits from being bundled in the same binary.

**The CLI uses Cobra for command routing:**
- `app.Run()` hands over to Cobra
- Cobra decides which command to execute based on CLI args

**The CLI has full knowledge of your application** — it's the same binary that runs your server:
- Endpoint structs are compiled in — codegen can reflect over them
- Migrations are embedded — no external files in production
- Optional: add custom commands to `go/main.go`

Your `go/main.go` wires everything up — all framework commands are already there.

## Docker Compose

schemaf ships with a **built-in compose configuration** that covers the full standard stack:

- Go backend (port 7000)
- Frontend dev server (port 7002)
- Postgres (port 7003)

You never write or maintain these service definitions. They are part of the framework.

**Extending with project services:**

If your project needs additional services (Redis, a worker container, a vector DB, etc.), add a `compose/` directory to your project:

```
myapp/
└── compose/
    └── services.yml    # Your additional services only
```

These become a full part of the application. Codegen merges the framework's built-in compose with everything in your `compose/` and produces `gen/compose.gen.yml`. Run `./schemaf.sh codegen` after checkout to regenerate it.

**No chicken-egg problem:** compose codegen is pure file I/O — no project binary needed.

**Running the stack:**

```bash
./schemaf.sh run              # Full stack, production mode
./schemaf.sh dev              # Full stack, dev mode (exposes service ports)
./schemaf.sh dev postgres     # Only specific services (useful during development)
```

`./schemaf.sh dev <args>` passes extra args through to `docker compose up` — useful for starting only a subset of services while running the Go server directly on the host (e.g. with a debugger).

## Code Generation

**One command generates everything:**

```bash
./schemaf.sh codegen
```

Copy `schemaf.sh` from the schemaf repository into your project root next to `schemaf.toml` and commit it. It uses `go run` to build a standalone schemaf CLI on the fly — no project binary needed, no dependencies beyond Go itself.

The schemaf CLI used here (`cmd/schemaf`) is a standalone entrypoint in the framework repository. It has no knowledge of your application — it only reads your project files from disk.

**What gets generated:**

1. **SQL → Go (sqlc)**
   - Auto-discovers `go/db/queries/*.sql`
   - Generates type-safe Go query functions → `go/db/queries.gen.go`

2. **Migrations → db.Provider**
   - Auto-discovers `go/db/migrations/*.sql`
   - Generates `go/db/migrations.gen.go` with `db.Provider` function
   - Provider returns embedded migrations to framework

3. **Endpoint structs → api.Provider + OpenAPI spec**
   - Auto-discovers endpoint structs in `go/api/*.go`
   - Generates `go/api/endpoints.gen.go` with `api.Provider` (handler registration)
   - Generates `gen/openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3.0 spec

4. **OpenAPI spec → TypeScript client**
   - Generates `frontend/src/api/generated/api.gen.ts` — type-safe client for your frontend
   - No running server needed

5. **Compose → gen/compose.gen.yml**
   - Merges schemaf's built-in compose (backend, Postgres) with your `compose/*.yml`
   - Used by `./schemaf.sh run` and `./schemaf.sh dev`

**Zero configuration.** Just run `./schemaf.sh codegen` and all the glue code appears.

## What is main.go?

Your `go/main.go` is the application entry point. It wires up the generated providers.

**Minimal example:**
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/yourorg/schemaf"
    "myapp/go/api"
    "myapp/go/db"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    app := schemaf.New(ctx)
    
    // Wire up generated providers (pass function references, not calls!)
    app.AddDb(db.Provider)      // Generated: migrations + queries
    app.AddApi(api.Provider)    // Generated: endpoint registration
    
    app.Run() // Hands over to Cobra CLI - blocking
}
```

**With optional customizations:**
```go
func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    app := schemaf.New(ctx)
    
    app.AddDb(db.Provider)
    app.AddApi(api.Provider)
    
    // Optional: mount custom CLI commands
    app.AddSubcommand("import", importer.SubcommandProvider)
    
    // Optional: register background services
    // These only run when "server" or "dev" command is used
    app.AddService(worker.ServiceProvider)  // Starts when server starts
    
    app.Run()  // Cobra handles command routing
}
```

**How services work:**

`app.AddService()` and `compose/*.yml` are two different extension points — they are not interchangeable:

| | `app.AddService()` | `compose/*.yml` |
|---|---|---|
| What | Go function run as a goroutine inside the binary | Additional Docker container |
| Use for | Background workers, schedulers, event loops | Redis, vector DBs, external processes |
| Lifecycle | Starts with the server, stops with the server | Managed by Docker compose |

- `app.AddService()` providers are **only started** when running `./schemaf.sh run` or `./schemaf.sh dev`
- `codegen` never starts services — stays fast and lightweight

**What gets wired:**
- `db.Provider` → function generated in `go/db/migrations.gen.go` (embedded SQL)
- `api.Provider` → function generated in `go/api/endpoints.gen.go` (handler registration)
- Framework calls these providers at the right time
- Everything else is framework-provided

## Endpoint Interface

API endpoints are structs implementing a typed interface — not plain `http.HandlerFunc` functions. This gives the framework enough information to handle serialization, auth, and OpenAPI generation automatically.

```go
// Your endpoint — in go/api/users.go
type GetUserEndpoint struct{}

func (e GetUserEndpoint) Method() string { return "GET" }
func (e GetUserEndpoint) Path()   string { return "/api/users/{id}" }
func (e GetUserEndpoint) Auth()   bool   { return true }

func (e GetUserEndpoint) Handle(ctx context.Context, req GetUserRequest) (GetUserResponse, error) {
    // your logic — no JSON parsing, no response writing, no auth checking
    user, err := db.GetUser(ctx, req.ID)
    return GetUserResponse{User: user}, err
}

type GetUserRequest struct {
    ID int64 `path:"id"`
}

type GetUserResponse struct {
    User db.User `json:"user"`
}
```

**What the framework does for you:**
- Decodes the request (path params, query params, JSON body) into `Req`
- Validates the request struct
- Checks the JWT if `Auth()` returns `true`
- Calls `Handle(ctx, req)`
- Encodes the response as JSON and writes the status code
- On error: maps the error to an appropriate HTTP status

**What codegen does with this:**
- Scans all structs in `go/api/` that implement the endpoint interface
- Registers them in `endpoints.gen.go` (`api.Provider`)
- Extracts `Req`/`Resp` types and generates a full OpenAPI spec
- Generates `frontend/api/openapi.gen.ts` — type-safe TypeScript client

You write the struct. Everything else is generated or framework-provided.

## Configuration: schemaf.toml

Projects have a minimal `schemaf.toml` file that defines:

```toml
title = "My Application"
name = "myapp"
```

That's it. Migrations live at `go/db/migrations/`, queries at `go/db/queries/` — normative, not configurable.

**Philosophy**: Maximum automation. If schemaf can generate it, you don't write it. We auto-discover files, generate glue code, and wire everything together. Paths are normative - no configuration needed.

## Port Convention

schemaf uses a fixed port allocation scheme to eliminate configuration:

```
7000           - Application server (main entry point)
                 Serves /api (Go handlers) and / (frontend)
7001           - Reserved (future use)
7002           - Frontend dev server (Vite, Next.js dev, etc.)
7003           - Postgres
7004 - 7009    - schemaf framework reserved
7010+          - Project-specific services (Redis, workers, etc.)
```

**Why fixed ports?**
- No port conflicts across projects (each gets its own range)
- No environment variables needed for service discovery
- Docker compose networking "just works"
- Clear convention: 700X for core, 701X+ for project services

## Repository Map

```
compose/        - Reusable compose blocks (postgres, future: redis, etc.)
example/        - Example project demonstrating schemaf usage
go/api/         - API registry + OpenAPI generation
go/server/      - Server framework (gateway, routing, frontend proxy/embed)
go/schemaf/     - App lifecycle (schemaf.New, app.Run)
go/cli/         - schemaf CLI framework (subcommands, config/state)
go/compose/     - Compose dependency resolver (x-schemaf metadata)
go/db/          - Database helpers + migrations
```

## Testing

**Running tests:**
```bash
./schemaf.sh test                  # regenerate code, then run all tests
./schemaf.sh test --verbose        # verbose go test output
./schemaf.sh test --no-cache       # bypass test cache
```

`./schemaf.sh test` always runs codegen first, then `go test ./go/...` and `npx tsc --noEmit`. This guarantees tests always run against freshly generated code.

Test output is formatted by [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum) when installed (recommended):

```bash
go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest
```

If `gotestsum` is not installed, `./schemaf.sh test` will warn you and fall back to plain `go test`.

**Go tests** live in `go/api/*_test.go` — standard Go test files using `httptest`.

**TypeScript tests** live in `go/tests/*.test.ts`. Write exported async functions named `test*`:

```typescript
// go/tests/api.test.ts
export async function testCreateUser(baseUrl: string) {
    const resp = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/users`, { method: "POST", ... })
    if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`expected 200, got ${resp.status}`)
}
```

Codegen scans these files and generates Go wrappers (`go/tests/ts.gen_test.go`) that start an `httptest.Server`, run the TypeScript via `npx tsx`, and report pass/fail as a standard Go test. Each TS test gets its own server instance.

To skip a TS test (e.g. requires a docker service not available in unit test mode), add a comment on the preceding line:

```typescript
// skip: requires clock docker service
export async function testClockTime(baseUrl: string) { ... }
```

The generated Go wrapper will call `t.Skip(...)` with that message.

## The One Binary Principle

Most application stacks are a collection of tools: a server process, a migration runner, a codegen CLI, a dev runner script, a separate frontend build, scattered admin utilities. Each has its own install, its own config, its own mental model.

schemaf collapses all of this into a single compiled binary:

| What | How |
|---|---|
| HTTP server | `./myapp server` — runs inside the container |
| Compose orchestration | `./schemaf.sh run/dev` — execs docker compose, then exits |
| Code generation | `./schemaf.sh codegen` — `go run`s the framework CLI, reads your files |
| Database migrations | embedded SQL, applied automatically on server startup |
| Frontend | embedded via `//go:embed` in production; proxied from port 7002 in dev (no rebuild needed) |
| TypeScript API client | generated from compiled-in endpoint structs at codegen time |
| Admin / custom tools | `./myapp <subcommand>` — anything you add via `app.AddSubcommand()` |

The binary has full knowledge of itself. Its endpoint structs are compiled in — so it can reflect over its own API to generate the OpenAPI spec and TypeScript client without a running server. Its migrations are embedded — so it can apply them on startup without external files. Its frontend is embedded — so production deployment is a single binary copy.

**What makes this unusual** is the self-referential quality of codegen: the binary looks inward to generate its own client. The same code that handles a `GET /api/users/{id}` request also describes that endpoint well enough to produce a type-safe TypeScript function for it. No separate spec, no annotations, no second source of truth.

The only thing outside the binary is docker compose — but even that is generated by `./schemaf.sh codegen`.

**Deployment is therefore trivial:**
```bash
go build -o myapp go/main.go   # one artifact
./schemaf.sh codegen            # generates gen/compose.gen.yml
./schemaf.sh run                # everything runs
```

No package manager. No deployment pipeline that installs twelve tools. No config files spread across the filesystem. One binary, one compose file, done.

## Design Philosophy

schemaf is **documentation-first**. We design by writing the README and docs for features that don't exist yet. The documentation is the source of truth for how the framework should work.

**Core principles:**
1. **Maximize decisions made** - Every choice you don't have to make is time saved
2. **Minimize configuration** - Zero config is the goal; convention over configuration
3. **Maximize generation** - If we can generate it, you don't write it
4. **Cement boilerplate** - Run scripts, codegen, compose layout, ports, database choice, glue code
5. **Single responsibility** - Framework handles infra, you handle business logic
6. **Fast to production** - Clone, add schema + handlers, run codegen, deploy

**The codegen philosophy:**
- One command (`schemaf codegen .`) generates everything
- Auto-discovery: find SQL files, Go handlers, migrations
- Auto-generation: sqlc code, migration providers, endpoint providers, TypeScript clients
- Auto-wiring: hook generated code into framework automatically
- No manual registration, no manual imports, no glue code
